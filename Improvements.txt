BUGS:


- If there are no blocks that we can place our maintenance stuff on, we will fail (specifically charging)
- If the tool doesn't have enough durability to set of the maintenance center.
- Assertions in gotoMaintenance were failing
- during the maintenance functions that DON'T use the customMove function, if a mob is in the way, the robot will fail to move




- the robot requires maintenance when it doens't really. Does this have to do with the energy prediction?
	- FIX THE energy prediction. Set to a constant 5000 or so. Do not use the average

- I need to use the Angel Upgrade to place blocks in thin air.
- Therefore, I need a better CPU to put in another upgrade.
