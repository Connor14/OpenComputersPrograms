BUGS:


- If there are no blocks that we can place our maintenance stuff on, we will fail (specifically charging) (FIXED I THINK)
- If the tool doesn't have enough durability to set of the maintenance center (I set a durability threshold of 10%)
- Assertions in gotoMaintenance were failing (they were removed)

- during the maintenance functions that DON'T use the customMove function, if a mob is in the way, the robot will fail to move

Tools MUST have durability. Cannot use electric tools.
